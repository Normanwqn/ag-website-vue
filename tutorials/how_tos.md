# How-tos
This document covers a variety of tasks not covered in [Getting Started](./getting_started.md).

Note that you can also merge 2 groups together using the "Merge Groups" button at the bottom-right of the page.

## Rerun Submissions
__IMPORTANT__: Do NOT delete any test cases while a rerun is in progress, as it may cause the rerun to get stuck in a retry loop. See https://github.com/eecs-autograder/autograder-server/issues/480 for our progress on fixing this issue.

In the project admin page, click or the "Rerun" tab. Follow the instructions on the page and choose which submissions and tests to rerun. Click the "Rerun" button to start the task, the progress of which will be updated periodically.
